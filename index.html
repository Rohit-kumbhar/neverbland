        <p>Based around Sprints we’ve cherry picked the best of proven project management and development methodologies; lean, agile & waterfall, which allows our Product Development Process to be flexible and results driven. Typically two weeks in duration, and with key deliverables defined upfront, you can think of a Sprint as a focused unit of work. This builds our projects step by step, with Sprints focussed on our Users, the Tech setup, Wireframes & Prototypes, Creative Concepting, Design & Development. We build Products to varying levels of stability, security, and scalability based on their anticipated lifespan and expected usage. Broadly, they will fall in to one of the following categories.</p>
